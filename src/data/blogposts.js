    title: "CSS Grid vs. Flexbox: When to Use Each",
    category: "Web Design",
    content:
      "Explore the differences between CSS Grid and Flexbox, and when to use each layout system. Flexbox is best for one-dimensional layouts, aligning items in either a row or a column, making it ideal for navigation menus and small UI components. CSS Grid, on the other hand, is suited for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to control both rows and columns simultaneously. Use Grid for complex web layouts and when you need more control over positioning elements. Combining both techniques can lead to highly responsive and visually appealing designs.",
